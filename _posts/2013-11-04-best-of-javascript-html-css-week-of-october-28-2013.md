A lot of great tutorials and a ton of new libraries this week. Check out how to use [pixi.js to create an infinite scroller game][1], [Bootstrap 3 as a workflow tool][2], [ExpressWorks][3] to learn Node and Express, and [npm-onupdate][4] to keep your libraries up to date. There are a couple of great "opinion" type pieces too (something I think many people are often scared to post). Check out Christian Helmann talking about [bad JavaScript practices][5], and Kirupa Chinnathambi explaining [why static comps are no longer enough.][6]
