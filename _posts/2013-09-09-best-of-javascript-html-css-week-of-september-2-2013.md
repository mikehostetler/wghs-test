A busy week of tutorials even despite the short week (the last update posted on Tuesday due to the holiday), mostly focused on using libraries or frameworks - many using Node. In fact, I think future updates may break out a specific Node section for tutorials. I spent late last week at the Blend Conference, which I highly recommend. There was a lot of talk among designers about Reflow and Photoshop, and not coincidentally a new update focused on improving the integration between the two launched today. 
## Tutorials Carlos Cessa shows how to use the Dropbox datastore API to share user saved data across Dropbox connected devices. 

[Dropbox Datastores and Drop-Ins][1] Mary Lou demonstrates an example layout where neighboring sections are positioned horizontally next to each other and slide into view [Sliding Horizontal Layout][2]. 
### Libraries and Frameworks Clliff Meyers shows how to mock server side dependencies to simplify local development of SPA’s through a sample app. 

[Mocking Server Dependencies in JavaScript and AngularJS][3] Brian Rinaldi shows how the Band.js library creates 8-bit game music using JavaScript and the Web Audio API by recreating music from Zelda. [Retro Game Music using Web Audio and Band.js][4] Aurelio De Rosa shows the new and old ways of creating and using custom filters for DOM elements in jQuery. [Creating Custom Filters in jQuery][5] Jack Franklin explores Browserify as an alternative to using RequireJS and shares his experiences. [Dependency Management with Browserify][6] Robert Kowalski discusses some recent features added to npm. [New Features in npm][7] Thomas Davis shows how you can update models and collections in real-time by integrating Backbone and PubNub. [Real-Time Backbone With PubNub][8] Guillaume Besson walks through how to build a chat service using Node.js and Websockets via Socket.io. [Using Node.js and Websockets to Build a Chat Service][9] Greg Smith explains how Node.js makes it easier to write tests for network code in his work on the Cloak project. [How Nodejs Makes Network Code More Testable][10] Ben Nadel explains you can provide explicit return values in JavaScript constructors that override the calling context. [Providing A Return Value In A JavaScript Constructor][11] 
### Mobile Christophe Coenraets shares a demo and code of how he implemented pull-to-refresh in a PhoneGap application using Topcoat. 

[Pull-to-Refresh in PhoneGap and Topcoat Applications][12] PhoneGap 3.0 included a lot of significant changes. Holly Schinsky goes over the details of the things you need to know. [PhoneGap 3.0 – Stuff You Should Know][13] Raymond Camden shows how to use the Panels widget which is one of the newer features in jQuery Mobile. [Working with jQuery Mobile Panels][14] 
## New and Updated Libraries and Projects FruitJS is a documentation generator built in Node that confverts documentation in Markdown into a nice site. 

[FruitJS Docs][15] Brackets Sprint 30 includes improved find/replace, open with Brackets on Windows and experimental live development for HTML. [Brackets Sprint 30 Build][16] heimcontrol.js does home automation with Raspberry PI and Arduino using Node.js, MongoDB, HTML5 and Websockets. [heimcontrol.js][17] 
## Etc. The latest episode of Topic Undefined (aka The Episode of Doom), a web and mobile developer podcast I do with Raymond Camden, is up. 

[Topic Undefined - Episode 4][18] The latest updates to Photoshop and Reflow including a newly reimagined integrated workflow between the two products. [Photoshop & Reflow][19] The September issue of Appliness features a ton of great tutorials and an interview with Vitaly Friedman.
