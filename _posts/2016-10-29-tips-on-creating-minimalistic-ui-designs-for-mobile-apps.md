<p style=\"text-align: justify\">For an increasing number of businesses, the website serves as the digital identity of the company. A modern, useful and content rich website is what allows you standing out from the competition and gain steady traffic and business conversion. Naturally, your website just cannot afford to look outdated and sluggish. It will create the same impression for your business. These days, people judge a business often by the user experience as the general standard of UX became too high in the recent times.

Similarly, if your images and media contents are not displayed properly over the interface, it is going to have a negative impression about your business.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">WordPress as a content management platform enjoys tremendous popularity largely because of the exceptional ease of use, flexibility, scalability and versatile feature set it provides. But before we look at the various aspects that make WordPress so invincible a choice let us have a quick look at the must have elements of a modern business optimized website.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Responsive and mobile friendly:</strong> Your business website must look great on all device screens.</li>\r\n 	<li style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Easy for business conversion:</strong> Your customers should experience ease in buying goods or ordering from your site.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Capable of delivering unmatched user experience:</strong> The website should offer a pleasing user experience by making it easy to access contents, features and allowing good readability and viewing of visual contents.</li>\r\n 	<li style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Clutter-free design:</strong> Your website should be stripped of the clutter and should be optimized for easier access by using a lot of white or negative space around contents.</li>\r\n 	<li style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Scalable with the business growth:</strong> Your website should be adaptive to the growth of your business.</li>\r\n 	<li style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Easy social media integration:</strong> The website should be capable of adding Meta tags easily so that the web contents get optimized views in social media when the post links are shared.</li>\r\n 	<li style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Easy to use and handle:</strong> The website should have an easy interface to allow publishing and updating contents and manage backend tasks.</li>\r\n 	<li style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Clear feedback mechanism:</strong> The website should have a robust feedback mechanism to guide users at every step for any action.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDoes WordPress as a CMS platform provides all these mentioned above? Yes, WordPress just perfectly addresses all these crucial requirements for a modern business website. To explain further the effectiveness of WordPress, let us have a look at the 6 key reasons that make <a href=\"http://nimblechapps.com/wordpress-website-development-company\">WordPress website development</a> as an invincible option for any modern website.\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">1. Exceptional ease of use</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">WordPress is exceptionally easy to use and offers an intuitive interface that allows quick access to all the features and control elements webmasters need.

WordPress latest updates always show in the dashboard and all you need is to run the update button and stay relaxed. It will be updated as per the latest security elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">5. WordPress is loved by search engines</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Do you know compared to any other CMS platforms WordPress sites have a better chance to rank higher on search engine ranks? Yes, it is loved by the search engines mainly because the code in WordPress site is clean and simple. The clean codes of WordPress allow more ease to search engine crawlers to find and index the contents of WordPress sites. Moreover, there is an array of great SEO plugins that guides you in clear step about all SEO attributes and help you perfecting them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">6. Versatile, flexible and customizable</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The most important thing about WordPress is that it is versatile in features and usability, flexible for diverse content and design elements and thoroughly customizable with the look, feel and design attributes. You can manage the WordPress website from any device since it offers a browser-based interface. Just by login through the web on any device you can manage the backend tasks of your site.

All three build tools allow you to bundle your js, compile your ES6 code, use SASS / SCSS, and more. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Unlike other tools, Webpack comes with a few assumptions by default. It assumes that you’re going to want to bundle your JS, and it assumes that you’re going to want to minify it in the process. Using Gulp and Grunt, you’ll need to download additional packages to bundle or minify your code. Since Webpack comes with these tools out of the box, we can spend less time configuring, and more time developing. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Let’s go through some of the basics so we can improve our load times and get our sites up to speed.</span>\n\n<h2><b>Installing Webpack</b></h2>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To install Webpack, all you need to do is run the following script in your terminal:</span>\n\n<code>npm install webpack -g</code>\n\nWith that in place, you’ll now be able to use Webpack to bundle modules and minify JavaScript.\n\n<h2><b>Module Bundling</b></h2>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bundling modules is quite simple as well. This allows you to cut down the amount of JS requests our app makes from many to one. Normally, our index.html file would look as follows</span><b>:</b>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-markup\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\"&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Up to Speed with Webpack&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r79/three.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/1.19.0/TweenMax.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"app.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;`\n</code></pre>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Rather than making requests to these scripts one by one, we can bundle them into one with Webpack. In app.js:</span>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var $ = require(\'jquery\');\nrequire(\'gsap\');\nrequire(\'three\');\n</code></pre>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And since we’re using the require statement to pull our scripts, we’re going to need to install them via NPM or Yarn:</span>\n\n<code>npm install jquery gsap three</code> or <code>yarn add jquery gsap three</code>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now if you run this in the browser, you’re going to get an error message saying <code>require</code> is not defined. This is where Webpack comes in. Compile app.js into build.js with the following:</span>\n\n<code>webpack app.js build.js</code>\n\nRemove your extra scripts in index.html, and replace app.js with build.js:\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-markup\">&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"build.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;</code></pre>\n\nView the page in the browser, and you’ll see that we’re only making a request to one script instead of four:\n\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Our first bundle of JS, what a beauty.</span></i>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<h2><b>Minification with Webpack</b></h2>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now 1.7mb is obviously a very large file to be loaded across the web. Our main culprit is the large library THREE.js. Let’s shrink it by minifying our JavaScript:</span>\n\n<code>webpack app.js build.js -p</code>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With Webpack, we were able to decrease our overall file size from 1.7mb to 670kb - about a 62% decrease. Nice. </span></i>\n\nAdding the <code>-p</code> to the end of this statement will run Webpack in production mode, meaning it’ll take out any excess code you don’t need, while minifying what you do need.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<h2><b>Setting Up a Config File</b></h2>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It’s quite cumbersome to have to type webpack app.js build.js into the terminal whenever you’d like for your scripts to be bundled. Luckily, we can create a config file which will automate the process.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Create a <code>webpack.config.js</code> file, and insert the following:</span>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">module.exports = {\n    entry: \'./app.js\',\n    output: {\n        filename: \'./build.js\'\n    },\n    watch: true\n}</code></pre>\n\nEntry is the file we’d like Webpack to compile, while the output filename is the destination we’d like app.js to be compiled into. Finally, setting the watch property to true will tell Webpack to watch for changes within app.js, and compile whenever one is made.\n\nRun Webpack in the terminal with this in place, and you now have a fully automated build tool waiting to bundle your code.\n\nThis is just scratching the surface when it comes to Webpack optimizations - with a little extra setup, you can have Webpack do much more, including minify, prefix, and inline your CSS, compile your SASS, SCSS, and ES6 code, and lint your JS - but the tools that come with Webpack right out of the box are a simple site speed booster.\n\nIf you have any questions about what we covered or about Webpack in general, feel free to leave a comment below.','','','inherit','closed','closed','','4142-revision-v1','','','2016-10-19 13:43:37','2016-10-19 18:43:37','<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Webpack is one of the newer players in the build tool ecosystem - and if you often find yourself needing to bundle all of your JavaScript into one file and minify it in the process, it’s the solution you’ve been looking for. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Similar to Gulp and Grunt, Webpack is able to automate your day to day development, while ensuring that your code is returned to the user in its most optimized form.

When it comes to incorporating minimalism in a UI design, it should be consistent, concise and clear. Your goal should be creating a minimalist mobile application that promotes usability and simpler navigation. To achieve that purpose take a look at the following tips:\n\n<b>Divide by Elements and Spacing, Not Lines</b>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dividers and lines are often used to delineate specific categories and sections within a screen. But, if you add too many of them, it can result in crowded interfaces.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fewer dividers and lines will give your interface a functional, modern and cleaner feel. The other ways to separate content are utilizing colors, spacing, and blocks. </span><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.calendar&amp;hl=en\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Google’s calendar app</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is an example of how using shadows and leveraging space instead of lines help in defining different sections.</span>\n\n<b>Simple Color Scheme</b>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A simple color scheme can always enhance the user experience. Having too many colors can create a negative impact as well. You can make creating new color schemes easier by taking a look at the predefined color scheme standards.</span>\n\n<ul>\n    <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong><em>Monochromatic scheme</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This type of color schemes comprises of different tints, shades, and tones within a particular hue. By altering the brightness and saturation of a hue, you can generate many colors and schemes that are not overwhelming for the eye.</span>\n\n<ul>\n    <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong><em> Analogous schemes</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This type of color schemes is created by using three colors that are positioned next to each other on the color wheel. Similar colors are usually used to prioritize the tasks and to highlight the critical ones. The items of most importance will be of the boldest color and things of least importance will be in the lightest color.</span>\n\n<b>One App, One Typeface</b>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When you are choosing a font for your application, keep in mind that it is always safe to rely on the default typeface of the platform</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Examples- Apple uses only </span><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/fonts/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">San Francisco family of typefaces</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to provide the readers with an experience that is consistent across all of its platforms. </span><a href=\"https://www.google.com/get/noto/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Noto</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and </span><a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Roboto</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> are the standard fonts on Google Chrome and Android.</span>\n\n<b>Blur Effects</b>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Blur effect is a perfect solution to create a minimalistic UI. It is because blur effects allow you to work quickly with layers and hierarchy of the UI. It is efficient for working with layered UI and also demonstrates the mobile solution\'s flow to the user. It also paves the opportunity for users to explore different overlay solutions and menu.</span>\n\n<b>Data Spotlight</b>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Always use a striking color and big font size if you to make a particular data the center of your user\'s focus. Using neutral colors for a general scheme can draw the user\'s attention. You can use contrasting colors for calls to action. This will help in channeling the users focus on the action which you want them to take.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you want to draw the user\'s attention to a particular area of the screen without additional visual hints, then increase the font size and use accent color. This makes the information-gaining process easy for the user.</span>\n\n<b>Icons: Stroke and Fill</b>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What is iconography? It can be considered as a visual language that can represent content or functionality. Icons should be recognized and understood easily by the user, and as a result, it should be simple. Since iOS7, a lot of minimalist UI has filled and stroke icons. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When it comes to bar icons, it serves as a form of navigation to go to another section of the application. To indicate which part of the application is active, you need to highlight it in one way or the other. This makes recognition of tabs which are active very easy.</span>\n\n<b>General Tips</b>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Always pay attention to the </span><a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/dd/2015/12/22/the-web-in-2016-long-live-responsive-design/#gref\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">different concepts of responsive design</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. This will make sure that your application is fully functional across different mobile devices and operating systems.</span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> If you are confused about which features should be incorporated and which features should be let go, and then involve real users while evaluating the mobile application\'s UI design. You will get different opinions and ideas that might improve your design.</span></li>\n    <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> To create a brilliant application user interface, you need to stick to the guidelines of the operating systems. Before submitting your mobile app to the app stores, research about the guidelines and how apps are featuring on these app stores successfully.</span></li>\n    <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> To keep your targeted user interested and to make your applications fully engaging, iterate the interface design options.</span></li>\n    <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> 508-compliance and security issues should be taken into account while creating UI designs for mobile applications.</span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Minimalistic UI designs can be created only by utilizing your creative side and technology. But, do you know that </span><a href=\"http://www.acuitytraining.co.uk/technology-and-creativity/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">technology and creativity</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> go hand in hand? Take a look at the infographic below to know more.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"https://modernweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acuity-training-1-1-768x5266.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4137 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https://modernweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acuity-training-1-1-768x5266.png\" alt=\"Infographic showing the 10 ways technology can improve your creativity\" width=\"768\" height=\"5266\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMinimalist interfaces and other different design techniques are the right paths to achieve a great layout. But, always remember that creating a minimalist interface should not be your only goal. Clear visuals, smooth user flow, and a great design is the perfect combination to create a seamless experience for the user.
