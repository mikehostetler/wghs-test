Like most crusaders for justice, he hates to see good citizens doing wrong by not using the appropriate standards or tags. This is one of the many reasons he balances his time between [the StackExchange network of sites][2] and hacking away at some of [his open source code][3]. When not arguing over semantics, he spends his spare time entrenched in ongoing battle against the mounting stack of books yet to be read, and video games yet to be played. A noble battle indeed.
