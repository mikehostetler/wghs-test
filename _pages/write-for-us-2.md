The future of tech depends on purpose — designers and developers strategically making products that solve problems. With Modern Web, we aim to chart a path for that future with content that explains why we make tech the way we do and how companies are using it to power their businesses. That’s why we tap the leading experts in Modern Web technologies — technologies that move the web forward — to share their ideas on where the web is going. 
### Who Writes for Modern Web? Typically, our writers are web developers and designers with a passion for solving complex technical and business problems using Modern Web technologies. Our content is focused on technical, instructive and innovative articles that leave our readers with new techniques and fresh perspectives that can be applied to their work. We work with and welcome contributors from all over the globe. 

### What Do We Write About? We generally focus on the following topics: 

*   Front-end development (e.g. JavaScript, HTML, CSS)
*   Back-end development (e.g. Ruby on Rails, Node.js, JavaScript, PHP)
*   DevOps (e.g. AWS, Heroku, infrastructure)
*   Design (e.g. Testing, usability, prototype, research, responsive)
*   Work (e.g. Agile, diversity, remote, productivity, work-life balance)
