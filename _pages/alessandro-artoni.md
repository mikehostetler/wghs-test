Alessandro is a front end web engineer with a passion for javascript and the open web platform. He was born and spent most of his life in Italy, living in Asti and studying in Torino, where he graduated. He is currently moving across Europe and can probably be found near London, Paris or Torino. His passion for web technologies started in the browser but soon enough he discovered the pleasure and magic of node.js. If you want to make Alessandro happy, make sure to gift him with a bottle of single malt scotch whisky...or even better, go and get a glass with him.
