Ryan Morr is a programmer residing in Barrie, Ontario, Canada with a real passion for everything related to front-end web development. JavaScript is his first love, a language that he feels always seems to stay fresh, inspiring creativity and evolving techniques to accomplish new solutions. Some of his other interests include sports, especially football and since he is a proud Canadian, of course hockey is his number one. He is a huge movie buff, favorites include Apocalypse Now, The Shawshank Redemption, and Saving Private Ryan. He also enjoys living a healthy lifestyle and exercise on a regular basis.
