The future of tech depends on purpose â€” designers and developers strategically making products that solve problems. With Modern Web, we aim to chart a path for that future with content that explains why we make tech the way we do and how companies are using it to power their businesses. Thatâ€™s why we tap  the leading experts in Modern Web technologies â€” technologies that move the web forward â€” to share their ideas on where the web is going.
